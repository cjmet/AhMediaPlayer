What as the most challenging part?
	Coloring outside the lines.  For both better and worse I chose a project outside the boundaries of what was covered in-class.  In hindsight I probably should have been advised my project may be too ambitious.  On the other hand I have learned more things than I can even mention that I would not have otherwise.  This has translated to a day or two or three, of additional research and study for every 2 or 3 hours of actual coding.  As a few examples.  I rewrote the background file discovery task 4 times, each version significantly better, and more in-line with what it should be.  The messaging task was rewritten 3 times.  Search task rewritten 3 times as I learned more and improved it.  File Caching, rewritten multiple times as well.  Those alone account for a couple weeks of daily work.  In addition to that are all the bugs (or features?) and eccentricities of Maui, that effectively account for the  majority of the rest of the development time.  With coding again being a fraction of the time spent versus debugging in that latter case.  ... On a positive note, I feel like I have a better idea of where to start and maybe how to do those tasks closer to the correct way if I did them each all over yet again.  A bit less lost in the woods now than then.
